These are some personal projects I have accomplished, including the ones in school. Feel free to refer responsibly. 

## DATA2002 
I used R Quarto to generate a reproducible report about the student population in DATA2X02 Sem 2 2024. 

The report structure is as followed: 
- Context
- Data Exploratory Analysis
- Data Cleaning
- Statistical Analyses
- Conclusion

## Stat2011 
I used R markdown to perform Monte Carlo Simulations and see the effect of Central Limit Theorem. 
The exercises allowed me to compare the fit between the theorectical and empirical probability distributions.
